## Reporting Issues

If you have found what you think is a bug, please file an [issue](https://github.com/raptisj/taxemu/issues)

## Suggesting new features

If you are here to suggest a feature, head to [discussions](https://github.com/raptisj/taxemu/discussions/new/choose) and submit your idea under the '**Ideas**' category. From there, we will discuss use-cases for the feature and then finally discuss how it could be implemented.

## General Guidelines

PRs should:
- be short and to the point
- be only about one particular thing
- have an example and a legit source to backup your idea

If a PR doesn't fulfill the above, it will be ignored.
